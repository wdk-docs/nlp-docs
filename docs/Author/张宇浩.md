## 关于我

Hey there, welcome!

I am a Ph.D.
student at Stanford University.
I am fortunate to be working with Prof.
Curtis Langlotz in the medical school and Prof.
Chris Manning in the NLP group on information extraction and its application in medicine.
Previously I have worked with Prof.
Russ Altman on biomedical relation extraction and knowledge discovery.

Before that, I obtained a M.S.
degree in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, with focus on Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction.
I also obtained a bachelor's degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University, China.

## 研究兴趣

My work has been primarily focused on knowledge - both acquiring knowledge from text, and using structured knowledge to power downstream applications.
For the former, I've worked on natural language processing, information retrieval and ontology.
For the latter, clinical informatics and biomedical knowledge discovery are the most exciting applications.
