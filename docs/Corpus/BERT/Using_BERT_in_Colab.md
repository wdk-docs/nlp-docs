# 在 Colab 中使用 BERT

If you want to use BERT with [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), you can get started with the notebook
"[BERT FineTuning with Cloud TPUs](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/tpu/blob/master/tools/colab/bert_finetuning_with_cloud_tpus.ipynb)".
**At the time of this writing (October 31st, 2018), Colab users can access a Cloud TPU completely for free.** Note: One per user, availability limited, requires a Google Cloud Platform account with storage (although storage may be purchased with free credit for signing up with GCP), and this capability may not longer be available in the future.
Click on the BERT Colab that was just linked for more information.
